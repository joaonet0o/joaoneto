            <p><h1>The Birth of TED Talks </h1><br><br> <br> 
                The group was founded in 1984, and the first conference took place in 1990. Originally influenced by Silicon Valley, 
                its emphasis was technology and design, but with the increase in popularity the topics covered became broader, covering almost all aspects of science and culture. <br>
                Conference speakers include Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Gordon Brown, Richard Dawkins, Bill Gates, the founders of Google, Billy Graham and several Nobel Prize winners.<br><br> <br> <br>
            </p> 
                 <h2>Organization</h2>
                 <p>Foundation staff work in New York and Vancouver. In the United States, TED conferences were held in Monterey until 2009, when they moved to Long Beach, due to the growing volume of audiences. <br>
                    More than five hundred lectures are available on the Internet. As of April 2009, they had been viewed more than one hundred million times by more than fifteen million people.</p>
                 <br> <br> <br>
            <h1>TEDx</h1>
          <p>In the spirit of ideas that deserve to be spread, in 2009, TED created the program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, independently organized events that bring people together to share a TED-style experience. <br>
            With events spread across the world, TED achieved an even greater reach in disseminating good ideas, so much so that in 2010 the first conferences were held in countries such as Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Armenia. <br>
             In Iraq, the first conference after the invasion was held on November 12, 2011, with the motto "Making the Impossible Possible", whose opening at TEDxBaghdad was held by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki
             and broadcast throughout the world via the Internet. <br></p>

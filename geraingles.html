           <p>TED is a non-profit organization with the aim of sharing ideas through talks, or, in Portuguese,
            conversations. Talks are a model of shorter and more effective talks to draw attention to a single topic</p>
            <br> <br> <br> 
            TED Talks are known for their limited duration, usually ranging from 5 to 20 minutes,
             which makes them accessible and impactful. This short time frame is designed to maintain 
             the audience's attention and convey information in a clear and concise manner. Since its
              inception, TED has evolved to include a wide range of topics, spanning areas such as science, 
              politics, education, and art, reflecting the diversity of voices and experiences of the speakers,
               ranging from scientists and artists to activists and entrepreneurs.
